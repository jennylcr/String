# String
This program reads product codes from text file (Codes.txt). Determine if each conforms to the rules:
*At least 10 characters (some codes have more than 10 characters)
*Positions 4 through 7 must be digits (and represents the country in which the product will be sold)
*The character in the 10th position must be a capital letter and represents the security level of the product.
*if the code is valid, due to new government security laws, products with a security level of R (restricted) are no longer to be sold in countries with a country code of 2000 or higher.
